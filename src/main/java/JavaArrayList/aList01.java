public class aList01 {
    /* 1) to create an "Array" we need to declare "the number of elements" at the beginning,
    we may need more elements to store or less elements to store inside the array.
    That is why declaring the number of elements at the beginning is not good. THis is the negative side of arrays.

     To remove that negativity, Java created a new structure whose name is "ArrayList", when we use "ArrayList",
    there is no need to declare the number of elements you want to store in it.
    As a result; "Array" is fixed in length, " ArrayList" is flexible

    2) "ArrayList" can store just "non-primitive" data, "Array" can store "primitive" data and "reference"

    3) "Arrays" work super fast
    arrays usr memory much less
    If you are sure the number of elements will not change (for example month names), using "Array" is better

    for Interview you need to know arrays very well and also arrayLists
